DIM crime
--> unique_row_id, filename, objectid, dc_dist, dispatch_date, location_block


DIM location:
---> lat, lng, zip




FACT CRIMES:
1. Join philly crimes with weather data to get temp for the dispatch date
2. Join philly crimes with playground data to get playgrounds with crimes 
----> Will want to filter to where the haversine distance between crime and park is less than 1 mile
----> Will want to collapse the parks into a list 






DONE:
STAGING PLAYGROUND:
1. Convert X --> lng, y --> lat, OBJECTID --> objectid, PARK_NAME --> name, AGE_RANGE --> age_range, zip --> zip 
2. CONVERT AGE_RANGE to ['5_12_YEARS' --> child, 'UNKNOWN' --> NA, '2_12_YEARS' --> mixed_age, '2_5_YEARS' --> preschool, ' ' --> NA]

STAGING PHILLYCRIMES:
1. Can convert hour into something like early morning, morning, afternoon, evening, late evening
